Airbnb is a prime example of a  company driven by the growth-at-all-cost model and uses the principle of ‘ extraction imperative’.
This is a decentralized web3.0 version of the AirBnb renting website built for EVM compatible blockchains.

## Project Organization
The project is divided into two major pieces since it is a full stack web 3 decentralized application created using Hardhat/React js:

Backend/smart contracts: Found in the hardhat folder, this section contains the blockchain development environment created using Hardhat, including all of the plugins, deployement scripts, and tests for the smart contracts (chainlink).
UI code is located in the src folder on the front-end side (as in all reactjs apps)


## Basic operations:
addRental: Charge a nominal charge to allow any user to put their property on the rentals page.
bookDates: If a reservation is made based on the vacation's start and end dates, the rantal will be accessible.
checkIfBooked: determine whether a certain rental is reserved for the user's dates.

## User Experience
The app, which has 4 pages and lets users rent anywhere in the globe and pay with cryptocurrency:

The user may check out all of the available homes, compare their costs, and view their various amenities by entering the city, the length of the vacation, and the number of guests on the main page, which serves as the app's landing page.

The user is led to the Rentals page after entering their travel details; it has a list of all the homes that fit their criteria and also displays their locations on a Google Map.

## AuthenticateMe

For transactions through metamask we created another app called AuthenticateMe which uses ethereum stack on goerli testnet and trnasactions are visible live on etherscan.
