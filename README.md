# Decentralized_AirBnb with AuthenticateMe For Transactions


Airbnb is a prime example of a  company driven by the growth-at-all-cost model and uses the principle of ‘ extraction imperative’.
This is a decentralized web3.0 version of the AirBnb renting website built for EVM compatible blockchains.

# Project Organization
The project is divided into two major pieces since it is a full stack web 3 decentralized application created using Hardhat/React js:

Backend/smart contracts: Found in the hardhat folder, this section contains the blockchain development environment created using Hardhat, including all of the plugins, deployement scripts, and tests for the smart contracts (chainlink).
UI code is located in the src folder on the front-end side (as in all reactjs apps)
